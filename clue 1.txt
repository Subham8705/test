I can ring without a voice,

I can signal without a choice.

I come in many shapes and sizes,

From temples to the church’s prizes.

I make a sound that fills the air,

But only when you’re close and care.

I’m often linked with time or toll,

And carry messages to the soul.

What am I?





































I go ding ding 12 times every 12hrs
go to line number 260 after finding me :)
